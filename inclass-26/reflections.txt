>Actually , I have learnt more than I expected initially I thought it is going to be usual JS stuff but having an understanding of the 'MERN' stack feels good. 

>I really enjoyed learning react-redux(despite the steep leaning curve) it is really such an efficent and clean way of building front end. I simply love it.

>I really found the course structure impressive. All the stuff we do in class and assignments are related and assembling  piece by piece the  full stack development puzzle is cool.

>I think in some inclass assignments we can take more time to complete cause I would love to do have some basic understanding of the concept instead of rushing to try to complete the inclass without enough background knowledge.    

All I can say it's the best class I have taken till date. No doubt it's hectic and maybe I could have performed better the learning experience is superb and Professor you are definitely the most helpful professor I have ever met.
