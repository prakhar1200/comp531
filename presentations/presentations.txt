Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
Presentation on Hybrid Mobile Apps and ReflectJS was the most polished and delivered properly. Hybrid apps  presenter had delivered  the contents very precisely and with code snippets. I could clearly understand the advantages and disadvantages of Hybrid Web Apps. I also like the ReflectJS as the presenter conveyed the content very clearly explaining  steps in detail and then demonstrating  on the web how to play with ReflectJS.


Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
I think I learnt from multiple topics ranging from  frontend development standards , responsive design frameworks to testing frameworks.  I have learnt some or the related frameworks in class so the topic I didn’t have any background was the one with Data Visualization using ReflectJS framework. I think data visualization is very important these days constant growth in Big Data. It’s good to learn about technologies using Javascript that can create impressive data analysis reports.


Which talk did you like the best and why?
The one that was of more interest to me was the one where different UI design  frameworks were compared. I have till now only used bootstrap but learning about other frameworks like foundation,  semantic UI , material design has convinced me to try them to have better UI design. I especially like Material Design and it’s components like float action button.
